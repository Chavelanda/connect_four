As project for the Languages and Algorithms for Artificial Intelligence course, it is proposed a Prolog implementation of the famous game Connect 4. It has been developed an Intelligent Agent (Alex), that is able to play against a skilled human player. To decide its moves, Alex uses the minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning and an heuristic specifically designed for this project. It is possible to play against the agent using the command line.
